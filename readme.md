# Project Title: E-shop Website

## Overview
This project demonstrates creating the front-end side of an e-shop website. The goal was to demonstrate my ability to create dynamic and responsive front-end projects.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Data:** JSON 

## Key Features
- **Menu:** The implemented menu contains different sections, and rearranges on mobile resolution.
- **Active filters section:** The section provides an element displaying the active filters. Each filter can be easily removed. The input fields provide an interface for adding new criteria.
- **Slider menu:** The slider menu gives options for sorting out the elements from the category.
- **Product Catalogue:** Initially, the catalogue was implemented by coding the front end for an item. In the process of improving the project, the way of displaying items was upgraded with dynamically filling data from a JSON file. This was realized with an async function that fetches data from an API using the fetch function.
- **Pagination:** The pagination is created after fetching data to find the count of the available pages and create buttons for them.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Created an admin dashboard for managing products, orders, and customer information.

## Challenges Faced
One of the main challenges was recreating the elements with the fetched JSON file data. 
Mobile menu design and implementation- it was challenging to figure out how to display and rearrange the menu on mobile resolution, but I realized that through hiding sub-items and showing them on tap.
Another challenge I faced was creating the pagination. As I decided to add more interactivity to the front-end code, I created functionality for the pagination.

## Lessons Learned
I learned new skills diving deeper into e-shop websites structure and functionalities, coding mega menus and their responsive views.

## Conclusion
Overall, this e-shop website project showcases my ability to code the front-end, fetch data, and create interactive elements using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery.
